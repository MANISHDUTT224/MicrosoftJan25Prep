### Repository Description:

This repository contains a collection of **Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA) problems** that I practiced in preparation for my **Microsoft Interview - January 2025**. It serves as a structured log of my learning journey, with solutions implemented in **Java** and optimized for clarity and efficiency.

### Highlights:  
- Covers a wide range of **DSA topics**, including arrays, strings, linked lists, trees, graphs, dynamic programming, and more.  
- Solutions are categorized by **difficulty level** (Easy, Medium, Hard) and problem type.  
- Focused on **Microsoft-specific patterns**, such as system design and problem-solving approaches common in their technical interviews.  
- Includes **edge-case handling** and detailed comments for better understanding.  

This repository is a valuable resource for anyone preparing for similar interviews or seeking to strengthen their DSA skills.
